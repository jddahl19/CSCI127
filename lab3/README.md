This is the third lab of my CSCI127 class. The instructions for it are posted below.

Assignment:

1)Download lab3.py
2)Replace the body of the count_vowels function such that it returns the number of vowels in the supplied sentence using the built-in count method. The function may assume that the supplied sentence contains only lowercase letters.
3)Replace the body of the count_vowels_iterative function such that it returns the number of vowels in the supplied sentence using a for loop. The function may assume that the supplied sentence contains only lowercase letters.
4)Rewrite the body of the remove_iterative function such that it removes all white space from the original sentence using a loop. (Do not use the built-in replace method.)
