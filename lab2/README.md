This program is the second lab of my CSCI127 course. Instructions are listed below:

Assignment:
Download 'etch-a-sketch.py' and rename it according to the instructions above.
Modify the code and add a second box that has text above that says "Move Mouse". 
Modify the listener code to check to see if the mouse clicks in the second box (the change color box should still work) and if it is clicked you will use two random numbers between will move your mouse to a new random spot on the screen. You can choose to draw lines when you move or not. 
You should move in all directions, which means you need random numbers between negative screen space and positive screen space (x , y). The whole screen should be used. Remember 0,0 is in the middle of the screen. You can always take a random number between 0 and width then subtract (width-middle) to get negative numbers.
